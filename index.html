    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img width="400px" src="image/Apartment With Context Whole.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
    <p style="width: 50%;">My name is Suwan Cho, and I am junior in Architecture. My design work often focuses on clarity, structure, and relationship between people and spaces they occupy. Studying abroad in the United States has helped me develop a broader perspective on architectural culture and design approaches. I am particularly drawn to architects such as Shigeru Ban and Kengo Kuma for their ability to balance structure, expression and experimentation. Overall, I aim to create architecture that is thoughtful, spatially clear, and grounded in real use rather than purely formal gestures. I am currently seeking an internship where I can continue developing my design skills and gain hands-on experience in a real architecture field.</p>
